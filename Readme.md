## Who are we?
A volunteer-led community initiative, Greater Life is operated by [Darren de Lima](https://robot-one.github.io). 

It is a consolidated continuation of two community projects:
- a Summer 2022 Civil Service/DWP work placement project which aimed to simply be a jobs index for the Wells High Street.
- a Winter 2019 Newbold College "Year In Mission and Service" project to help mental health in the local community via online workshops under the banner of "Greater Life".
