**Warning: Website is a work-in-progress! Information may be incorrect or outdated.**

We have launched the Wells Community Jobs website public demo! More features are coming soon: 

<!--more-->

- a reorganisation, to cover a lot more than just jobs
- a rebranding, to cover Glastonbury and Shepton Mallet, as well as Wells
- theme improvements (there are still a lot of broken links, fonts, scripts and unused features)
- proper licensing for images, and additional volunteer maintainers to help out! 

Currently, the website source code is available at https://github.com/Greater-Life/greater-life.github.io

I am [Darthagnon a.k.a. Darren de Lima](https://robot-one.github.io), electromechanical engineer, product designer/manufacturer, junior webdev, sysadmin and former Civil Servant. I aim to continue serving the public in an unofficial capacity (or official, if possible) for the time being, this website being one initiative. 

Please bear in mind that the site is currently public for demo purposes only, and there will be major changes incoming. In the meantime, feel free to contact me via my website with any questions, suggestions, or offers of help or employment ðŸ˜…
